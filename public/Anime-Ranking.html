<h1>The Best Animes According to Krys</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Favorite Animes</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
<p>I grew up with this and I want to be like Goku, plus, it has a good story. It tells us that we must be strong and good, and we must learn how to 
    forgive.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    "Power Doesn't respond to a desire" <br>
    "But to a need"<br />
    "You must create that need"<br>
    <b><i>- <u>Son Goku</u> -</i></b><br>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>I love the fact that they talk about the spirit realm, it adds a completely new dimension to the whole thing. It emphesize on the fact 
    that we must protect what is dear to us.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    "I will protect you!"<br>
    <b><i>- <u>Ichigo Kurosaki</u> -</i></b><br>
</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>I love the phylosophycal aspect of this anime.<br />
</p>
<p>
    "Believe it!"<br />
    <b><i>- <u>Naruto Uzumaki</u> -</i></b>
</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>It is not just a funny anime, it talks about our world, from politics, to civil war and slavery. It's deep.<br />
</p>
<p>
    "I will become the King of Pirates!"<br />
    <b><i>- <u>Monkey D. Luffy</u> -</i></b>
